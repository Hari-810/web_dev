JavaScript is a **programming language** primarily used to make web pages **interactive**. It allows developers to create **dynamic** and **responsive** experiences for users by manipulating HTML and CSS, handling user inputs, and communicating with servers.

### **Key Purposes of JavaScript:**

1. **Client-Side Interactivity** – Enables dynamic behavior such as animations, form validation, and real-time updates without refreshing the page.
2. **DOM Manipulation** – Allows modification of HTML and CSS elements (e.g., changing text, styles, and structure dynamically).
3. **Event Handling** – Responds to user interactions like clicks, keypresses, and mouse movements.
4. **Asynchronous Programming** – Supports AJAX and Fetch API for fetching and sending data without reloading the page.
5. **Server-Side Development** – Used in backend frameworks like **Node.js** to build APIs and handle requests.
6. **Cross-Browser Compatibility** – Runs on all modern browsers without the need for additional plugins.
7. **Game & App Development** – Used in game engines (like Phaser) and mobile app frameworks (like React Native).
