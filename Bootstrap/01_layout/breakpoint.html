<!-- 
    d-none: This class is used to hide an element on all screen sizes. It essentially makes the element invisible and takes up no space.

d-block: This class is used to make an element visible on all screen sizes. It displays the element as a block-level element, taking up the full width of its parent container.

d-sm-none: This class is used to hide an element on small (SM) screens and larger. In the HTML file, it hides the content on screens with a width of 576px (SM) and above (i.e., it is visible only on extra small or XS screens).

d-md-block: This class is used to make an element visible on medium (MD) screens and larger. In the HTML file, it makes the content visible on screens with a width of 768px (MD) and above.

d-lg-block: This class is used to make an element visible on large (LG) screens and larger. In the HTML file, it makes the content visible on screens with a width of 992px (LG) and above.

d-xl-block: This class is used to make an element visible on extra large (XL) screens and larger. In the HTML file, it makes the content visible on screens with a width of 1200px (XL) and above.

These classes are part of Bootstrap's responsive utility classes, and they allow you to control the visibility of elements at different breakpoints. By combining these classes strategically, you can create responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes and devices.
