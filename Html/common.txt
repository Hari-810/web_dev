What is html?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
It is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web.
HTML documents are comprised of elements, which are the building blocks of web pages.
These elements are represented by tags, enclosed in angle brackets, such as <html>, <head>, <title>, <body>, etc.
HTML is used to structure content on web pages, including text, images, links, forms, and multimedia. 
It provides a way to format and organize information so that it can be displayed in web browsers.
Additionally, HTML works in conjunction with other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to enhance the presentation and functionality of web pages.
