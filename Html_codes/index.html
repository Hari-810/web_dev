    A "tag" is a fundamental building block used to structure and format content within a web page. 
    HTML tags are used to define elements on a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, 
        and more. 
    Tags are enclosed within angle brackets ("<" and ">") and often come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. 
    The closing tag typically includes a forward slash ("/") before the tag name.


    <!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration at the very beginning specifies that this document is written in HTML5, the latest version of HTML.

    <html lang="en">: This is the opening tag for the HTML document. It sets the language of the document to English ("en").

    <head>: This is the opening tag of the head section of the HTML document. 
        The head section typically contains meta-information about the document and links to external resources.

    <meta charset="UTF-8">: This meta tag specifies the character encoding of the document, which is UTF-8. UTF-8 is a widely used character encoding that supports a wide range of characters from different languages.

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: This meta tag is used for responsive web design. It sets the initial scale of the viewport to 1.0 and adjusts the layout to the device's width. This is important for ensuring that the web page looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

        <!-- 
            Web Pages: On the web, metadata is often used to provide information about web pages. 
            HTML meta tags, such as <meta name="description" content="This is a description of the web page">, 
             are used to provide a brief description of the page's content.
            Metadata in web pages can also include keywords, character encoding information, and viewport settings.

<!-- 
    <title>Document</title>: This is the title of the web page. It appears in the browser's title bar or tab. In this case, the title is simply "Document," but you can change it to whatever you want to describe your web page.

    </head>: This is the closing tag for the head section.

    <body>: This is the opening tag for the body section of the HTML document. The body section contains the visible content of the web page.

    <h1>this is my first page</h1>: This is a heading element (<h1>) with the text "this is my first page." Headings are used to define the structure and hierarchy of content on a web page, with <h1> being the highest level and typically used for the main title.

    </body>: This is the closing tag for the body section.

    </html>: This is the closing tag for the HTML document, indicating the end of the document.
